# miRNA-diff-expr
Differential expression analysis for miRNA sequence data, starting from a counts matrix.
Started using Python Jupyter notebooks, but have now transitioned to using R Markdown Notebooks.

This project was created for the [Tewari Lab](http://www.tewarilab.org/) at the University of Michigan.
